# Todo App Full Stack

This is a Todo App built using a Full Stack architecture. The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js with MongoDB as the database, and the frontend is developed using Flutter with API integration.

## Backend

The backend of this Todo App is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on todo items. MongoDB is used as the database to store todo data. Here are the key components of the backend:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that provides robust features for building APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store todo items.

### Installation and Setup

To set up the backend:

1. Install Node.js and MongoDB on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
4. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
5. Start the server using `npm start`.

## Frontend

The frontend of this Todo App is built using Flutter, a cross-platform UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Freezed package is used for API integration, and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture is implemented for better code organization.

### Features

- View, add, edit, and delete todo items.
- Mark todo items as completed.
- Filter todo items by status or category.
- Search for specific todo items.
- Dark mode support.

### Installation and Setup

To set up the frontend:

1. Install Flutter and Dart SDK on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
4. Install dependencies using `flutter pub get`.
5. Run the app on an emulator or a physical device using `flutter run`.
